# smart_webdesign_agency
Yet another work that took my attention from behance. 

Workflow:
Behance to Responsive HTML (no PSD provided from the author).
I'm not a graphics guy. So I skipped graphics work like Shapes and Images that are used in original behance design. Instead, I took graphics from undraw.

Used Techs and Languages:
- HTML
- SCSS
- Flexbox (frow)
- Pure Javascript

Note: No Jquery or Jquery plugin used in this project.

Design owners: Ariba Yeasmin, Pixency Academy
